# Agile Fundamentals With Scrum and Kanban Framework

### Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Uncovring better ways meaning Learning as an origanization or a team on how to get better at developing software.

1. ****Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools:*** we value people and we value interactions among people and we value people inteacting with each other and businesss. As part of valuing indviduals and interactions, we will value face to face communication.
2. ***Working software over comprehensive documentation:***
3. ***Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:*** We want to collaborate and delight our customers. When we write out contracts, let's keep our customer's success in mind.
4. ***Responding to change over following a plan:*** Let's value being ready for changes and responding to any change.

### 12 Agile Principles

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in devleopment. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficeint and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsers, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicty-the art of maximizing the amount of work not done-is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams. 
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts it's behavior accordingly. The key principle that how to improve ourselve what went wrong etc.

3. Work Together Daily
4. Working Software is key
5. Reflect and Adjust
6. Face-to-Face Conversations
7. Simplicity

- Why agile is better because in tradinationl water fall modal you can't go back and if you idetifiy some changes then it ll take a lot of time and resources to change those things that's why agile is perfect to move betweeen different phases of software life cycle.
- Down side of agile is lack of documentations because mostly that happens in conversation meeting etc. 

### Scrum Framework

Lightweight framework designed to solve complex problems that required sprinting or iterating through a solution. Scrum rules come from Values, inspection, adaption and transparency.
- Sprint or time-box anywhere from 1-4 weeks: Planning, developing, testing and reviewing of a working unit of software is completed with this time box.
- In summary, scrum is an agile way of developing software or any project.
- Scrum is more of a framework than a methodology or process.
- If there is a challenge or a conflict in the team, they come together and discuss and decide on a own way to move forward as a team.
- Outside of software scrum  is used in operations, startups, government and marketing.
- In summary, scrum is  very unique because it has specific roles/responsbilities, ceremonies and artifacts.
- Sprint is the heart of a Scrum framework
- Sprint or time-box: Sprint planning, daily standup, sprint review and retrospective all happen inside of the sprint or the time-box.
- Scurm Roles-> Product owner: Talk to the stakeholders and users to understand their needs and vision of the product. 
- Scrum master: Enusres scrum understood and used skilfully by scrum team. Scrum master is a serant leader. Models agile mindset and scrum framework. 
- Development team: Build product increment, dev team is cross functional, self organizing as a team, three to nine people.
- Product Owner: A product owner is a role on a Scrum team that is responsible for the project's outcome. The product owner seeks to maximize a product's value by managing and optimizing the product backlog. Scrum is an Agile software development framework that enables a team to communicate and self-organize.

  ### Scrum Ceremonies and Events
  
  1. Daily standup meeting: Answer three questions, what did you do yesterday? what you ll do today and do you have any impediments.
  2. Sprinit planning meeting: a sprint backlog comes out of the sprint planning meeting sprint backlog is the amount of work that the team member agreed to work on that sprint.
  3. What is sprint review: Meeting conducted by the team to share the outcomes of the sprint with external stakeholders. Who attends a sprint review?: Sprint review are attended by the entire team including the prodcut owner. idealy the customer is present at the sprint review. How long is a sprint review?: Sprint reviews are normally between 1 and 2 hours in length. 
  4. Sprint Retrospective: Retrospective meaning what did the team do well, what did not go well in this last sprint and what should be improved on.
  5. Backlog Refinement: Once the sprint is live, you also want to prepare for you next sprint.
